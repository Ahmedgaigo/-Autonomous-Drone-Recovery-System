# -Autonomous-Drone-Recovery-System
## Overview
This project aims to develop an autonomous system for deploying and recovering a drone from a rocket, utilizing Python for embedded systems and flight control algorithms. The system includes trajectory planning, real-time flight control, communication protocols, obstacle avoidance, and data logging for post-mission analysis. It serves as a demonstration of integrating software engineering principles with aerospace technology, showcasing proficiency in Python programming and practical application in autonomous systems.


## Features
- **Trajectory Planning:** Calculate optimal paths for the drone from the rocket's payload bay to a designated recovery zone.
- **Autonomous Flight Control:** Implement algorithms for stability, attitude control, and navigation during descent.
- **Communication and Telemetry:** Establish bidirectional communication between the drone and a ground station for real-time monitoring and control.
- **Safe Landing Mechanism:** Develop algorithms for obstacle detection and avoidance to ensure safe landings.
- **Data Logging and Analysis:** Record telemetry data (altitude, speed, GPS coordinates) for post-mission analysis and evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python: for embedded systems programming and flight control algorithms.
- Sensors: GPS, accelerometers, and other relevant sensors for navigation and telemetry.
- Communication Modules: RF modules or other communication protocols for ground station communication.
